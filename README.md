## Project objectives
. Assess overall sales performance over time

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key EDA activities included:

i.Trend analysis of sales over time (monthly and yearly)

ii.Comparison of sales performance by product category

iii.Regional sales contribution analysis

iv.Customer segmentation analysis

v.Identification of peak and low-performing periods
## Key Insights

Sales show clear seasonal trends with identifiable peak periods

1.A small number of products/categories contribute a large share of total revenue

2.Certain regions consistently outperform others

3.Customer purchasing behavior varies significantly across segments

## Recommendations

Focus marketing and inventory efforts on high-performing products and regions

1.Develop targeted strategies for underperforming segments

2.Leverage seasonal trends for promotions and demand planning
